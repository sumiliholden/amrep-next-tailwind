    question: "How does the 1 Week Free Trial work?",
    answer:
      "At PREPP.photo, we are 100% confident that you will find us to be an amazing partner in your photography business. To get a sample of our work, we offer all new clients a 1 Week Trial.

    question: "How do we share files with the PREPP office?",

If there is an issue using Dropbox, don't be shy about chatting with one of our team members for an alternative solution.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the turnaround time?",
    answer:
      "Typically Photos, Videos, and Virtual Twilights are delivered by 10am (EST) on the following day from when the raw files are uploaded. One exception is that we do not work on Saturday evening which means both Saturday and Sunday jobs will be delivered on Monday at 10am. In the future we will implement 7 day service coverage.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long are my finished files stored for?",
    answer:
      "Due to the extremely high volume of photos we process daily, we typically archive (delete) finished files from the Dropbox folder once per month. You may retain a copy of the files on your own personal Dropbox account with no issue, but it is necessary for us to clear the space on our side.",
  },
  {

    question: "What happens if I have a problem with my edits?",

  },
  {
    question: "Where is PREPP.photo located?",
